Using OWM JAPIs, you only need to focus on your application and its user interface, and you can just leave 
the work of accessing weather and forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.org on this library. This reduces code 
in your program and improves the readability and performance of your code.



##How to use OWM JAPIs?
Add OWM_JAPIs.jar and JSON.jar to your project's libararies directory, and then, code this way:

1. Create and initialize object of OpenWeatherMap

3. This object's functions returns desired data in a new object
4. Call this new object's functions to get information about weather

Using OWM JAPIs is very simple, and anyone with little coding knowledge will feel at home while making use 
of this library. Identifiers are written to be self-explanatory and java documentation is also provided.
